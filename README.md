# HybridCryptography
```Hybrid encryption is a mode of encryption that merges two or more encryption systems. It incorporates a combination of asymmetric and symmetric encryption to benefit from the strengths of each form of encryption. These strengths are respectively defined as speed and security```

 ```RSA is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm and 
The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key block cipher.
This is a java Application simulating Hybrid cryptography using the above algorithms```
