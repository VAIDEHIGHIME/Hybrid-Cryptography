# Hybrid Cryptography

```
Hybrid encryption is a mode of encryption that merges two or more encryption systems.
It incorporates a combination of asymmetric and symmetric encryption to benefit
from the strengths of each form of encryption.
These strengths are respectively defined as speed and security.
RSA is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm and 
Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key block cipher.
This is a java Application simulating Hybrid cryptography using the above algorithms
